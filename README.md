In general github projects will be software that you are building. Hence a readme is in order explaining the project.  The following is not an exhaustive list, but some questions you might answer could include:
1) What is this? (this is a thing doer that does these things)
2) Why did you make this? (it solves problem X)
3) If it’s software for particular users, what should they be able to do? (User should be able to use doThing module to get their things done better)
4) What technologies did you use to make it? (JavaScript, MySQL,  Bootstrap, Firebase)
5) What are you required to have to use it? (requires Node.js installed in a Linux/Unix environment)
6) What are the steps to install/use it? (i.e. run such and such install script, then point your browser to myhost.com:3000)
7) Related projects (forked from…, inspired by…, etc)
8) Contributors/collaborators….
9) What’s next/forthcoming features?

Obviously for a homework assignment, many of these things don’t really apply, but some of them kind of do, so get in the habit of creating a README with as much of this info is relevant as possible.

For civilian pedestrians: they would like to know where are the crimes happening.

For drivers stuck in traffic: where is the accident ahead of them.
